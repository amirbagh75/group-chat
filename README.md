# Why ?

I like to learn software engineering. One of the best ways is to develop open source and public projects. If there is a wrong architecture or there are some better ways to do something, the software community will teach it to me. And finally I would like to share my knowledge with others.

# How to install?
1. install composer ([reference](https://getcomposer.org/download/))

2. install swoole extension ([reference](https://www.swoole.co.uk/docs/get-started/installation))

3. run `git clone https://github.com/amirbagh75/real-time-messaging.git` to clone this repository 

4. run `composer install` in the root directory of application

5. run `cp .env.example .env`

6. run `php artisan key:generate`

7. run `php artisan swoole:http start` and everything should be ok now ðŸ˜¬
